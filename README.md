# DETE_survey
Cleaning and visualizing employee exit survey data from Australia.

This guided project was part of the Data Science in Python course on Dataquest.com.

In this notebook, I showcase data cleaning, visualization, and analysis techniques to answer two questions from these data:

1. Are employees who only worked for the institutes for a short period of time resigning due to some kind of dissatisfaction? What about employees who have been there longer?
2. Are younger employees resigning due to some kind of dissatisfaction? What about older employees?

Take a look at the notebook to find the answers!
